# -- podcast README -- #

This program is licensed GPLv3-or-later.

Included:

* podcast: the app
* config: an example config file

Start by opening up podcast and changing $cfg->{config} to have the correct 
path to the config file.

Next, open up the config file and change the paths for <cache> and <local> 
to point to a cache directory and a local audio directory, respectively.  
These could well be the empty directories created by untarring, or they 
could be elsewhere if you feel so-inclined.

Input the information for the feeds you're interested in, following the model 
in the included entries.


Additional notes added by Bradley M. Kuhn <bkuhn@ebb.org>:

  I downloaded this script at some point in 2006 and have been maintaining
  a personal fork of it ever since.  Note that I've hard-coded a number of
  paths in both the podcast script and the config file, and have also
  added all my podcasts to the default config file.

  I removed the use of the MP3lib stuff, as I now make system() calls out
  to id3v2.

  Finally, I finally just stopped listening to mp3 files when I got a
  player that only supported ogg.  So, I added a feature to convert
  everything to ogg files, and uses vorbiscomment and mpg321 to convert
  the file to ogg.

  I doubt this is useful to anyone.  People have asked me on occasion what
  I use to download pocasts, so I put this code up here.  I actually
  recommend bashpodder instead.  I'd use it myself if I hadn't been using
  this code since before bashpodder existed.  The best I can say about
  this code is IWFM.
