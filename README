# -- podcast README -- #

Included in this tar file:

* podcast: the app
* config: an example config file
* cache/: an empty cache directory
* audio/: an empty audio directory

Start by opening up podcast and changing $cfg->{config} to have the correct 
path to the config file.

Next, open up the config file and change the paths for <cache> and <local> 
to point to a cache directory and a local audio directory, respectively.  
These could well be the empty directories created by untarring, or they 
could be elsewhere if you feel so-inclined.

Input the information for the feeds you're interested in, following the model 
in the included entries.
